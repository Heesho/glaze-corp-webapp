# Glossary

Definitions of key terms used throughout GlazeCorp documentation.

---

## A

### APR (Annual Percentage Rate)
The expected yearly return on an investment, expressed as a percentage. In governance, it represents the annualized return from bribe rewards relative to staked value.

### Auction
A mechanism for price discovery. GlazeCorp uses Dutch auctions where price starts high and decreases over time.

---

## B

### Base
An Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain where GlazeCorp contracts are deployed. Chain ID: 8453.

### Bribe
In governance, rewards paid to voters for voting on a particular strategy. Not negative - it's an incentive mechanism.

### Bribe Split
The percentage of strategy auction payments that go to bribe contracts (and thus to voters).

### Burn
Permanently removing tokens from circulation by sending them to an unrecoverable address (typically 0xdead).

---

## C

### cbBTC
Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin - a tokenized version of Bitcoin on Base, used as a payment token in governance strategies.

### Claim
The action of withdrawing earned rewards from a contract.

---

## D

### DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
An organization governed by smart contracts and token holders rather than a central authority.

### Deadline
A timestamp after which a transaction will fail. Used for protection against delayed execution.

### Decay
The decrease in Dutch auction price over time. Price "decays" from initPrice toward zero.

### Delegate
Assigning your voting power to another address. They vote on your behalf while you retain the tokens.

### DONUT
The native token of DonutDAO, minted through the mining process.

### DPS (Donuts Per Second)
The emission rate of DONUT tokens. Starts at 4 and halves every 30 days.

### Dutch Auction
An auction where price starts high and decreases over time until a buyer accepts. Opposite of traditional "English" auctions.

---

## E

### Epoch
A time period in the system:
- Mining epoch: ~1 hour (price decay period)
- Voting epoch: 7 days (vote locking period)

### Epoch ID
A counter that increments each time someone mines. Used for frontrun protection.

### ERC20
The standard interface for fungible tokens on Ethereum.

### ERC20Votes
An extension of ERC20 that adds voting and delegation capabilities.

---

## F

### Flush
Sending accumulated revenue from the RevenueRouter to the Voter for distribution.

### Franchise
GlazeCorp's token launchpad for creating new tokens with permanent liquidity.

### Frontrun
When someone sees your pending transaction and submits their own first to take advantage. Dutch auctions and epochId protect against this.

---

## G

### Gas
The fee paid to process transactions on the blockchain.

### gDONUT
Governance DONUT - the non-transferable token received when staking DONUT. Represents voting power.

### Glazing
The act of mining DONUT (taking over as the active miner).

---

## H

### Halving
A 50% reduction in emission rate. DONUT halves every 30 days.

---

## I

### Index
In the Voter contract, a global accumulator for tracking revenue distribution efficiently.

### initPrice
The starting price for a Dutch auction epoch.

---

## L

### LP (Liquidity Provider)

### LP Token
A token representing ownership of a portion of a liquidity pool.

### LSG (Liquid Signal Governance)
GlazeCorp's governance system where votes "signal" how revenue should be allocated.

---

## M

### Max Price
The maximum amount a user is willing to pay, used for slippage protection.

### Miner
The current holder of the mining position who earns DONUT tokens.

### Multicall
A contract that batches multiple operations into a single transaction for efficiency.

---

## N

### Normalize
Adjusting relative weights to sum to 100%. If you vote [50, 30, 20], they're normalized to 50%, 30%, 20%.

### Non-transferable
A token that cannot be sent to another address. gDONUT is non-transferable.

---

## P

### Payment Token
The token used to pay for strategy auctions (e.g., cbBTC, USDC, DONUT).

### Price Multiplier
The factor by which initPrice increases after an auction purchase. E.g., 2x means next initPrice = lastPrice × 2.

---

## R

### Revenue
Income generated by the protocol from various sources (mining fees, franchise fees, etc.).

### Revenue Router
Contract that accumulates and forwards protocol revenue to the Voter.

### Rig
In Franchise, the mining contract for a launched token. Same mechanics as the DONUT Miner.

---

## S

### Slippage
The difference between expected and actual price. Max price protects against excessive slippage.

### Stake
Locking tokens in a contract. Staking DONUT gives you gDONUT.

### Strategy
A contract representing a use for protocol revenue. Each strategy has an associated payment token.

---

## T

### Tail Emission

The native token created for each Franchise project.

### Unstake

---

## 0

### 0xdead
